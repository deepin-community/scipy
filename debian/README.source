=== submodule source ===

According to https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/16331
some git submodules are needed to build scipy since version 1.9.x

The script debian/get-submodules clones the scipy repository
initialises the submodules and creates a submodules tarball.

Note, the script requires rsync.

The scipy version used for the submodules is extracted from
debian/changelog, or alternatively may be specified as a argument to
this script (gbp import-orig, for instance, needs the submodule source
to be already downloaded)

Submodule source is generated strictly for the indicated version
if the git tag v$VERSION is available, otherwise git HEAD is used.

Script Usage:  get-submodules [VERSION]


=== debian/scipy_doc ===

version_switcher.json is used to build docs and is downloaded from
https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/_static/version_switcher.json
